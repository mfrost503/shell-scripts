## Rick Roll

There was a time...where people would try to Rick Roll you every chance they could.
Thankfully that time has passed...but with the passing of time, comes a greater amount of
shame and humiliation when you are caught off guard and Rick Roll'd hard, so hard.

Well fear no more! Do you have a pesky co-worker who's always trying to get one over on you?
Before you open any of their links, run them through this handy-dandy little tool and never
get caught with Rick Astley crooning your shame for the whole office to hear.

It's pretty easy to use, just run `./rick-roll <url-from-your-mischievous-coworker>` and get
instant feedback on whether or not a Rick Roll attempt is in progress...
